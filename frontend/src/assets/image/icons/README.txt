SVG vector files in this folder were made with Inkscape, a free & open source vector illustration app for Windows & Linux.
[Get Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/)

Note #1: These files use a custom Inkscape version of the SVG format. While not incompatible with standard SVG renderers, 
the custom format uses several features not described in the SVG standard. Therefore, unexpected rendering issues may occur.

Note #2: It is not recommended to use these SVG files directly in the app. To use these images, please convert them to PNG files.
This can be done in Inkscape by opening the file, then going to File -> Export PNG Image. Please pay attention to the image's
pixel density & dimensions to ensure that the exported image is of good quality for the intended use case.
