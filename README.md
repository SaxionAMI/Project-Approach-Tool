# Project-Approach-Tool

## About

The Project Approach Tool helps students and professionals determine their project approach by defining the necessary deliverables (called "stepping stones") to achieve the end goal, formulating the questions to be answered to get the necessary information, and choosing the methods to answer these questions and realize the deliverables.

This tool is based on two frameworks: Stepping Stones by Miriam Losse (Saxion), and the DOT framework by Koen van Turnhout (HU, formerly HAN), and makes use of the card decks that have been developed to enable people in the use of these frameworks. 

The project is currently being developed by Saxion, but we welcome anyone to contribute.

## Installation and deployment

See the readme files in the front-end and back-end folders.

## Version history

### v1 - Basic functionality
Allows an end user to define phases (groups of cards), select stepping stone and methods cards already present in the server, and to locally add question cards and any custom cards of preference. Relationships between phases can be indicated by adding arrows.
Developed by Matyas KÃ¶ne as part of his graduation project.

### Upcoming functionality in v2

Lars Hendriks is the second HBO-ICT graduation student who will work on this project, and he will be working on:

- online storage of workspaces
